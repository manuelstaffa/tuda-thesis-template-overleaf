In this chapter, we will examine the technical details of our implementation. We will start by describing the target user groups, the architecture of the project and the frameworks used. We will then describe the API of the project and how the individual components interact with each other. Finally, we will describe the key implementation details of the project, focusing on the Operator and the Grader. \cite{imrad}
